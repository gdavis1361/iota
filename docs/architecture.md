# IOTA Architecture

## Overview

IOTA (Infrastructure Operations and Tracking Architecture) is a comprehensive performance tracking and metrics storage solution for cloud infrastructure management tools.

## System Components

### 1. Core Components

#### Performance Monitor
- Context manager-based operation tracking
- High-precision timing (nanosecond accuracy)
- Automatic slow operation detection
- Thread-safe metric collection

#### Metrics Storage
- SQLite-based persistent storage
- Thread-safe operations
- Configurable retention periods
- Aggregated statistics generation

#### Configuration Management
- Environment-based configuration
- Strict type validation
- Secure secret handling
- Test environment support

### 2. Supporting Services

#### Database Layer
- SQLite for metrics
- PostgreSQL for main application data
- Redis for caching and rate limiting

#### Monitoring & Alerting
- Metric aggregation
- Performance threshold monitoring
- Error rate tracking
- Alert generation

## Data Flow

1. Operation Monitoring
   ```
   Operation Start → Performance Monitor → Metric Collection → Storage → Aggregation
   ```

2. Alert Processing
   ```
   Metric Threshold Check → Alert Generation → Alert Routing → Notification
   ```

## Security Architecture

### Authentication
- Environment-based configuration
- Secure credential storage
- API key management

### Authorization
- Role-based access control
- Operation-level permissions
- Audit logging

## Deployment Architecture

### Components
- Core services
- Database services
- Monitoring services
- Alert handlers

### Scaling Strategy
- Horizontal scaling of core services
- Database replication
- Cache distribution
- Load balancing

## Integration Points

### External Systems
- Cloud providers
- Monitoring systems
- Alert destinations
- Authentication services

### Internal Services
- Inter-service communication
- Event propagation
- State management
- Cache synchronization

## Development Architecture

### Code Organization
- Core modules
- Service implementations
- Test suites
- Configuration management

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests
- Integration tests
- Performance tests
- Security tests

## Future Considerations

### Planned Enhancements
- Distributed metrics collection
- Advanced visualization
- Machine learning-based anomaly detection
- Enhanced alert correlation

### Scalability Plans
- Multi-region support
- Enhanced caching
- Improved data partitioning
- Performance optimizations
