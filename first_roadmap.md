Below is a concise roadmap to restart the project with a solid foundation:

---

### **1. Environment & Infrastructure Setup**

- **Docker & Environment Isolation:**
  - Create a clean Docker-based environment that mimics production.
  - Configure your Dockerfile and docker-compose to set the correct environment variables and PYTHONPATH.
  - Ensure no local modules (e.g., a custom `logging.py`) shadow standard library modules.

- **Environment Configuration:**
  - Use a dedicated configuration module (with Pydantic v2) to load and validate all environment variables from a clearly defined `.env` file.
  - Implement a bootstrap module that *first* loads your environment variables, then instantiates configuration as a singleton, and finally initializes logging and other services.
  - Include Sentry DSN and environment-specific settings in your configuration.

---

### **2. Core Foundation Components**

- **Logging System:**
  - Start by implementing and testing your logging system in isolation.
    - Integrate your asynchronous logging handler (AsyncLogHandler), ensuring proper instantiation of handlers (using lambdas or factory functions in your config).
    - Add structured logging with correlation IDs, sensitive data masking (SensitiveDataFilter), and optional output formats (JSON for production, human-readable for development).
    - Configure Sentry integration with your logging system to automatically capture and forward relevant errors.
  - Build out comprehensive unit tests (using pytest) that cover:
    - Async logging under load
    - Format switching
    - Error resilience and fallback behavior
    - External monitoring integration (Sentry and other applicable services)
    - Verify proper error context capture and breadcrumb tracking

- **Error Monitoring Setup:**
  - Initialize Sentry SDK early in the bootstrap process
  - Configure performance monitoring with appropriate sample rates
  - Set up custom context providers for enhanced error tracking
  - Implement custom event processors for sensitive data scrubbing
  - Configure release tracking to correlate errors with deployments

- **Resolve Dependencies:**
  - Refactor module relationships to remove circular dependencies (e.g., move shared utilities to a utils module).
  - Use dependency injection when possible so that logging and configuration modules do not implicitly pull in database dependencies.

---

### **3. Testing & Isolation**

- **Test Infrastructure:**
  - Set up your test configuration in `pytest.ini` (or similar) to ensure tests run in an isolated environment.
  - Mock external dependencies (like the database and Sentry) entirely during early testing to focus on core system stability.
  - Verify all logging tests pass (async, formatting, masking, etc.) before proceeding.
  - Include specific tests for error capturing and reporting workflows.

- **Iterative Validation:**
  - Run your test suite inside the Docker container to simulate production.
  - Use the detailed logging (with correlation IDs) to quickly pinpoint any initialization or configuration issues.
  - Validate error reporting pipeline with controlled test errors.

---

### **4. Incremental Feature Reintroduction**

- **Stabilize Core Before Additional Features:**
  - Once logging, configuration, and error monitoring are robust, reintroduce business logic features incrementally.
  - Validate each new component (e.g., database interactions, JWT authentication, CORS handling) independently, then integrate with the stable logging/config foundation.
  - Add appropriate error boundaries and Sentry transaction monitoring for each feature.

- **Documentation & Monitoring:**
  - Update your README or a dedicated internal document with detailed instructions for bootstrapping, configuration settings, and troubleshooting.
  - Document Sentry integration, including custom context setup and performance monitoring configuration.
  - Consider integrating additional external monitoring (ELK, Splunk, etc.) once the core logging and error reporting systems are proven in a production-like environment.
  - Set up Sentry alerts and notification workflows for critical errors.

---

### **Summary**

**First things first:** Rebuild the environment and foundational modules by:

1. **Setting up Docker** for consistent, isolated environments.
2. **Implementing and thoroughly testing the configuration, logging, and error monitoring systems** (ensure environment variables are correctly loaded, logging handlers are properly instantiated, and Sentry is capturing errors effectively).
3. **Ensuring proper module decoupling and test isolation** to validate these core components.
4. **Gradually reintroducing other features** (like database and JWT) into this stable base, with comprehensive error tracking.

Following this step-by-step approach will ensure you start with a solid, observable foundation that makes future debugging and expansion significantly easier.
